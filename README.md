# Time_Series_Analysis
Time Series Analysis Modelling (ARMA and ARIMA models and Auto ARIMA is trained.)

Data is obtained from one of my lectures at DTU. 
(Sales of 8 products for each day between certain time range from an e-commerce website is taken). 
I don't have any information regarding the correctness or existance of data in real life. 

Main points during the project;

- Stationarity of sales is examined.
- Data transformation methods are discussed.
- ACF, PACF plots are created and AR & MA components are discussed.
- ARMA and ARIMA models are created via checking ACF and PACF plots.
